# ðŸš€ The PHP Compiler Script [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SergiX44/ISPC-PHPCompiler.svg?branch=bash-version)](https://travis-ci.org/SergiX44/ISPC-PHPCompiler)

This script will help you to manage different PHP version for your webserver (especially made for ISPConfig installations). 
This supports **auto compiling and auto configure feature** with a **very high optimization level** (`-O3` `-march=native` `-mtune=native` flags) for PHP >= 5.6. See the versions.sh file to see them.

At every launch a new version of the `versions.sh` file is imported from this repository, it **ensure always up to date links and builds**.

# How to use
Just run this command in your shell to download and run the script, and then just follow the instruction on your screen:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SergiX44/ISPC-PHPCompiler/bash-version/php-compiler.sh; chmod +x php-compiler.sh; bash php-compiler.sh
```
